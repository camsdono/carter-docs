<h1>Quick Fix to Problems</h1>


<h3>1. Agent does not converse properly:</h3>

It sometimes happens that your Agent get's stuck while conducting a conversation. This happens when you keep on asking the same questions for example.
To reset your agent without greater hassle it is as simple as just writing Hello into the conversation with your agent. 
This resets it and you can now return to your standard conversation.

<h3>2. Agent keeps responding to your custom trigger even though you didn't write the trigger word/sentence</h3>

This happens when you only got one trigger set or if you only have 1 phrase or word to look for. To get a better Response behaviour you should put
multiple trigger phrases. For example if you want to ask for its name you could put down example phrases like:
What is your name? , Name?, what do they call you?, who are you?, what do people call you?

The more phrases you add the better the agent will react in future. This and playing arround with the threshold slider will help you get good results.
