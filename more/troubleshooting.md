# Troubleshooting

We all have those days, this section is to simply highlight some out-of-context things to try first. If you're really stuck, reach out to us on Discord!\


**My Agent does not converse properly.**

Agent's pay close attention to conversational history. If you agent conversation appears to be going off on a tangent this is likely because your agent has become confused with the conversation. This happens a lot when you're testing things, speaking repetitively etc. You can reset this by simply restarting the conversation like you would with a human, a simple 'hello' should do it.



**My agent keeps saying 'Sorry, I didn't quite catch that'**

Ensure 'Allow open conversation' is enabled under Dashboard > Agent Editor > Configure (Tab) > Allow Conversation.



**Custom triggers are activating too often**

If your trigger is activating too often, try increasing the confidence to around 65-85%. You could also try to re-write some of the example phrases.



**Custom triggers aren't activating at all**

If your trigger is not activating, try adding more example phrases, adjusting existing ones or lowering the sensitivity to around 40%.
