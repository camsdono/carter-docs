# Scene Control

Control which trigger's activate in different scenes by simply passing your scene as a string to the API and adding it as a condition in the trigger editor.

**A few notes on behaviour:**

* If a trigger has a scene condition added it will **only** activate in that scene.
* If no scene is added it will **always** trigger.
